# An automated sample generation method by integrating phenology domain optical-SAR features in rice cropping pattern mapping
This is an official implementation of POSTAR method in our paper: An automated sample generation method by integrating phenology domain optical-SAR features in rice cropping pattern mapping

The workflow of POSTAR  mainly included three procedures: <br>

GEE_code/01-PPPM corrosponding to GEE code for Step 1;<br>
GEE_code/02-Export SAR data corrosponding to GEE code for exporting VH and VH/VV time series of potential rice samples;<br>
Two-step refinement strategy/TwoStep_Refinement_Strategy corrosponding to python code for Step3, ;<br>
